# **Social Finance Digital Labs - Better Children in Care Data Alpha**

## Background

This Alpha project was a cross-council partnership of seven councils led by Greater Manchester Combined Authority and funded by the Local Digital Fund to improve the quality of data on children in care. We supported the delivery of the project with helpful support and feedback from Ministry of Housing, Community and Local Government and the Department for Education. 

## Problem

Children in care are among the most vulnerable groups in our society. Compared to their peers, they are 5 times more likely to be excluded from school, 4 times more likely to be involved with youth justice system and 40 times more likely to become homeless.

Throughout the country, local councils are working hard to close this gap. They are looking for evidence to understand the kind of support that can improve the outcomes of children in care. Unfortunately, the data needed to measure program effectiveness and inform service provision isn’t always of good quality. Even though local councils do collect a lot of data on children in care, they are not used to their fullest potential because children’s services leaders do not trust the data’s accuracy. 

## Solution

In this Alpha, we developed a prototype that could help local councils identify and resolve errors in their children in care data throughout the year. We focused on a common statutory process (SSDA903) and built the prototype so that users can access it by simply loading a URL in a web browser. This circumvents the often lengthy process of getting data processing agreements or IT approval from each local council.
